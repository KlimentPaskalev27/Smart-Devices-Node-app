# Smart-Devices-Node-app
A basic UI web app created in Node.js and Express.js. The app aims to allow users to log in new devices and their properties to a database of existing devices. Each device has specific properties so the Add Device page form changes dynamically based on chosen option.

## Context
The main idea behind the app is the fictional scenario that an app should be written in Node to allow users to connect their smart devices at home to their account. When the device is added, then the user can change the settings of that device so they can control the device from their phone or PC.
